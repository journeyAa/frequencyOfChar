    2. write a program that asks user how many numbers he wants to enter,
    and get all the user inputs and store them into an array variable,
    and then write the program that can return maximum and minimum numbers
    3. Write a program that can return the average number from an array of integers
            ex: [1,2,3]
            average: 2
            [10, 15, 5, 6]
            average: 9
            [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 20, 30, 0]
            average: 10*/

        4.
        5. Write a program that will take five Strings and save them into an array called arr.
         and  Use for loop to print out the first three letter of each element of arr, one per line.
        You can assume that every element of arr is at least 3 letters long.
                Example: arr -> ["apple", "banana"]
