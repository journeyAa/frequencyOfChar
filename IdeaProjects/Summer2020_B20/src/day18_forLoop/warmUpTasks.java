        For loop Intro (Maybe)
package : day17_StringReveiw
Warmup tasks:
1. Ask user to enter two words. Then add them together and print. But if the last letter if the first word and the first letter of the last letter is the same, print that character once.
                    Input:
                        one
                        eight
                    Output:
                        oneight
2. write a program that asks user's first and last name, then prints out the initials of the user

                input:
                    cybertek
                    batch18
                output:
                    your initial is: CB
        DO NOT use charAt method
3. write a program that can reverse the following string:
                String str = "Java";
                output: avaJ
            please provide two solutions:
                        first solution, you MUST use substring method
                        second solution, you MUST use charAt method
4. write a program that will return the domain of an email address:
            Ex:
                input: test@gmail.com
                output: the domain of the email is: gmail
                inputL: Cybertek@yahoo.com
                output: the domain of the email is: yahoo
String: Sequences of characters. Object. immutable

        object:
            1. String literal:
                        String str = "Cybertek";
                        goes to String pool
                         String str2 = "Cybertek";
                         1 object is created in String pool
            2. new keyword:
                        String str = new String("Cybertek");
                        in heap memory
                        String str2 = new String("Cybertek");
                        2 objects created in heap
String methods: charAt, +, length, upper, lower, trim, substring, replace, replaceFirst, indexOf, lastIndexOf, equals, equalsIgnorecase, isEmpty, ends, starts, contains
