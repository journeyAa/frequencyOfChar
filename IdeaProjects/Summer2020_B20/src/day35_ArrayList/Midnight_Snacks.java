/*
warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that can set the last element of the Integer arraylist to zero
            ex:
                list = [1,2,3,4,5];
                output: [1,2,3,4,0];
    2. write a program that can multiply each odd number by 2
            ex: list = [1,2,3,4,5];
                output: [2,2,6,4,10]
    3.  write a program that can find the unique elements from an ArrayList of integers and stores into another
    list called uniques
            ex: list==> {1,1,2,3,3,4,5}
                uniques ==> {2,4,5}
