    task01:
        Create a class named Cities
                Declare 3 String variables
                    city1
                    city2
                    city3

                            Moscow
            Print: use the city variables
                    From Tashkent to Kyiv is $500

                    I have been to Tashkent, Moscow, Kyiv.
    task02:
            Create a class CompanyInfo
                Declare variables:
                            companyName

                                Annual revenue is 4 000 000
                                is it tech company? - true
    task03:
            create a class called Swap, and write a program that can swap two variables' values wihtout using temporary variable
                    Ex:
                        int a =10;
                        int b= 15;
                    output:
                        System.out.println(a); ===> 15
                        System.out.println(b); ===> 10
    task04:
            Create a class called SalaryCalculator, write a program that can calculate the taxt, and salary after tax based on the hourly rate & tax rates
                ex:
                    if: rate = 55;

                        federalTaxRate =0.22;
                        weeklyHours = 40;
                    then output will be:
                            your salary is: 105600 USD
                            your total tax is: 27456 USD
                            your income after tax is: 78144 USD
